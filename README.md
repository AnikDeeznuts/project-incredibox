Incredibox Archive Project

This is an website that is an archive of some Incredibox games that have discontinued over the years. This includes both versions of Bite Size Beats, and Axe Boat. I also use it
for a couple other things too, so don't be suprised if you see random commits going nowhere. I haven't really updated this in a while, but if something goes wrong, you can either
post an issue or contact me elsewhere. Enjoy!
